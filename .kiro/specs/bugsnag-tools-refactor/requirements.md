# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current Bugsnag client implementation has all tools defined in a single large `registerTools` method within the `BugsnagClient` class. This monolithic approach makes the code difficult to maintain, test, and extend. The refactoring will break down the tools into modular, focused components that are easier to understand, test, and maintain while preserving all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the Bugsnag MCP server, I want the tools to be organized into separate, focused modules, so that I can easily understand, modify, and test individual tool implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN each tool SHALL be defined in its own separate module
2. WHEN a tool module is created THEN it SHALL contain only the logic specific to that tool
3. WHEN examining a tool module THEN it SHALL be self-contained with clear dependencies
4. WHEN adding a new tool THEN it SHALL require minimal changes to existing code

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working on the codebase, I want consistent patterns across all tool implementations, so that I can quickly understand and work with any tool module.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing tool modules THEN they SHALL follow a consistent interface pattern
2. WHEN a tool is registered THEN it SHALL use the same registration mechanism as other tools
3. WHEN tool parameters are defined THEN they SHALL use consistent validation patterns
4. WHEN error handling is implemented THEN it SHALL follow the same patterns across all tools

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer testing the Bugsnag client, I want each tool to be independently testable, so that I can write focused unit tests and isolate issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tool module is created THEN it SHALL be testable in isolation
2. WHEN testing a tool THEN it SHALL not require the entire BugsnagClient to be instantiated
3. WHEN mocking dependencies THEN it SHALL be straightforward to mock only the required dependencies
4. WHEN running tests THEN each tool's tests SHALL be independent of other tools

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user of the MCP server, I want all existing functionality to work exactly as before, so that the refactoring doesn't break my current workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all existing tools SHALL function identically to before
2. WHEN calling any tool THEN it SHALL return the same response format as the original implementation
3. WHEN using tool parameters THEN they SHALL accept the same inputs as before
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled and reported in the same way as before

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer extending the Bugsnag client, I want a clear and simple way to add new tools, so that I can implement new features without modifying core client logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a new tool THEN it SHALL require creating only a new tool module
2. WHEN registering a new tool THEN it SHALL be automatically discovered and registered
3. WHEN a tool module follows the standard pattern THEN it SHALL integrate seamlessly with the client
4. WHEN the client initializes THEN it SHALL automatically load all available tool modules

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want clear separation of concerns between tool logic and client infrastructure, so that I can modify tools without affecting core client functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing tool logic THEN it SHALL be separate from client initialization and configuration
2. WHEN the client provides shared services THEN tools SHALL access them through well-defined interfaces
3. WHEN tool implementations change THEN they SHALL not require changes to the core client class
4. WHEN client infrastructure changes THEN it SHALL not require changes to individual tool modules
