# SmartBear MCP VS Code Extension

An extension to install the SmartBear MCP server which provides AI assistants with seamless access to SmartBear's suite of testing and monitoring tools, including [Insight Hub](https://www.smartbear.com/insight-hub), [Reflect](https://reflect.run), and [API Hub](https://www.smartbear.com/api-hub).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ and npm
- Access to SmartBear products (Insight Hub, Reflect, or API Hub)
- Valid API tokens for the products you want to integrate

## Configuration

During installation, you will be prompted to enter the API tokens for the SmartBear products you want to use. If you do not have access to a product, you can leave the field blank.

For Insight Hub, if you provide a project API key it will narrow down all searches to a single project in your Insight Hub dashboard. Leave this field blank if you wish to interact across multiple projects at a time.
