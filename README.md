A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides AI assistants with seamless access to SmartBear's suite of testing and monitoring tools, including Insight Hub, Reflect, and API Hub.

## What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to securely connect to external data sources and tools. This server exposes SmartBear's APIs through natural language interfaces, allowing you to query your testing data, analyze performance metrics, and manage test automation directly from your AI workflow.

## Supported Tools

See individual guides for suggested prompts and supported tools and resources:

- [Insight Hub](https://developer.smartbear.com/smartbear-mcp/docs/insight-hub-integration) - Comprehensive error monitoring and debugging capabilities.
- [Test Hub](https://developer.smartbear.com/smartbear-mcp/docs/test-hub-integration) - Test management and execution capabilities
- [API Hub](https://developer.smartbear.com/smartbear-mcp/docs/api-hub-integration) - Portal management capabilities


## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ and npm
- Access to SmartBear products (Insight Hub, Reflect, or API Hub)
- Valid API tokens for the products you want to integrate

## Configuration

The server is started with the API key or auth token that you use with your product(s). They are optional and can be removed from your configuration if you aren't using the product.

### VS Code with Co-Pilot

The SmartBear MCP server is distributed as an NPM package [`@smartbear/mcp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@smartbear/mcp), making it easy to integrate into your development workflow. You can add it to your VS Code environment in three convenient ways:

1. **Direct NPM installation** - Install the package directly using npm or your preferred package manager
2. **VS Code command** - Use the built-in "MCP: Add serverâ€¦" command in VS Code for guided setup
3. **Manual configuration** - Add the configuration directly to your `.vscode/mcp.json` file for custom setups

For the quickest setup, we recommend using the Direct NPM installation or VS Code command approach. If setting up manually, add the following configuration to `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "smartbear": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@smartbear/mcp@latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "INSIGHT_HUB_AUTH_TOKEN": "${input:insight_hub_auth_token}",
        "INSIGHT_HUB_PROJECT_API_KEY": "${input:insight_hub_project_api_key}",
        "REFLECT_API_TOKEN": "${input:reflect_api_token}",
        "API_HUB_API_KEY": "${input:api_hub_api_key}"
      }
    }
  },
  "inputs": [
      {
         "id": "insight_hub_auth_token",
         "type": "promptString",
         "description": "Insight Hub Auth Token - leave blank to disable Insight Hub tools",
         "password": true
      },
      {
         "id": "insight_hub_project_api_key",
         "type": "promptString",
         "description": "Insight Hub Project API Key - for single project interactions",
         "password": false
      },
      {
         "id": "reflect_api_token",
         "type": "promptString",
         "description": "Reflect API Token - leave blank to disable Reflect tools",
         "password": true
      },
      {
         "id": "api_hub_api_key",
         "type": "promptString",
         "description": "API Hub API Key - leave blank to disable API Hub tools",
         "password": true
      }
  ]
}
```

### Claude Desktop
Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "smartbear": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@smartbear/mcp@latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "INSIGHT_HUB_AUTH_TOKEN": "your_token_here",
        "REFLECT_API_TOKEN": "your_reflect_token",
        "API_HUB_API_KEY": "your_api_hub_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Testing Locally

Test your installation using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector):

```bash
INSIGHT_HUB_AUTH_TOKEN="your_token" REFLECT_API_TOKEN="your_reflect_token" API_HUB_API_KEY="your_api_hub_key" npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx @smartbear/mcp@latest

```

This npx terminal command opens a web interface where you can test tools and resources before integrating with your AI assistant.

## Local Development with VS Code

For developers who want to contribute to the SmartBear MCP server, customize its functionality, or work with the latest development features, you can build and run the server directly from source code. This approach gives you full control over the implementation and allows you to make modifications as needed.

    },
    "inputs": [
        {
            "id": "insight_hub_auth_token",

            "password": true
        },
        {
            "id": "insight_hub_project_api_key",
            "type": "promptString",
            "description": "Insight Hub Project API Key - for single project interactions",
            "password": false
        },
        {
            "id": "reflect_api_token",
            "type": "promptString",
            "description": "Reflect API Token - leave blank to disable Reflect tools",
            "password": true
        },
        {
            "id": "api_hub_api_key",
            "type": "promptString",
            "description": "API Hub API Key - leave blank to disable API Hub tools",
            "password": true
