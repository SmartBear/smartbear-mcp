### Security Considerations

-   Token management - Rotate API tokens regularly and store them securely.
-   Environment isolation - Use separate tokens for development, staging, and production.
-   Audit logging - Monitor API token usage and access patterns.

### Performance Optimization

-   Query specificity - Use specific time ranges and filters to reduce data transfer.
-   Caching awareness - Understand that some data may be cached for performance.
-   Rate limiting - Be aware of API rate limits and implement appropriate delays.
-   Batch operations - Group related queries when possible.

### Troubleshooting Workflows

1.  Start broad, then narrow - Begin with overview queries, then drill down into specifics.
2.  Use temporal context - Include time ranges in your queries for better results.
3.  Combine data sources - Correlate error data with performance metrics for comprehensive analysis.
4.  Document findings - Use the AI assistant to help document investigation results.

### Integration with Development Workflow

-   Pre-deployment checks - Query recent error trends before releases.
-   Post-deployment monitoring - Set up automated queries to check release health.
-   Code review enhancement - Include error context in pull request discussions.
-   Sprint planning - Use error frequency data to prioritize bug fixes.
