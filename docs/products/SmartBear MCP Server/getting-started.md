This guide is to help you get up and running with our MCP server.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Before setting up and using the SmartBear MCP Server, ensure you have:¬†

-   An active account across our relevant hubs (e.g.¬†[API Hub](https://try.platform.smartbear.com/?product=ApiHub),¬†[Test Hub](https://app.reflect.run/registration), and/or¬†[Insight Hub](https://app.bugsnag.com/user/new)).
-   Node.js 20 or later installed on your development machine
-   A compatible MCP client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)
-   Valid API credentials for the relevant hubs.

### Installing the Server

The SmartBear MCP Server is now available as an NPM package, and can be installed globally or as a project dependency.

Many IDEs and tools now support the¬†"Add MCP Server"¬†workflow, which automatically installs the server without requiring any manual setup. For example, for VSCode¬†you can add our MCP server directly in VSCode using the¬†`"MCP: Add server"`¬†command and giving the NPM package.¬†

Alternatively, you can install directly using NPM by following the instructions below.

To install the server globally, run:

```
npm install -g @smartbear/mcp

```

This will make the¬†`mcp`¬†command available globally on your system, allowing you to start the server from any directory.

Alternatively, you can add it as a dependency in your project:

```
npm install @smartbear/mcp

```

### Authentication Setup

The SmartBear MCP Server supports multiple SmartBear Hubs, each requiring its own authentication token. You only need to configure tokens for the products you plan to use:

For API Hub access:

1.  Log in to your API Hub dashboard
2.  Navigate to¬†Profile¬†‚Üí¬†API Key
3.  Click the "Copy API Key" button

For Test Hub (Reflect) access:

1.  Log in to your Test Hub (Reflect) dashboard
2.  Navigate to¬†Settings¬†‚Üí¬†Account Information
3.  Scroll to the "API Access" section

For Insight Hub access:

1.  Log in to your Insight Hub dashboard
2.  Navigate to¬†Settings¬†‚Üí¬†My account/Personal auth tokens
3.  Generate a new token

> üîê Store your tokens securely. They provide access to sensitive data and should be treated like passwords. You can use any combination of the supported products - tokens for unused products can be omitted.

## Configure Environment Variables

The following environment variables based on which SmartBear hubs you want to access:

```
# Required for Insight Hub tools
export INSIGHT_HUB_AUTH_TOKEN=your-insight-hub-auth-token

#(Recommended when using Insight Hub Tools)
# The API key for the Insight Hub project you wish to interact with. Use this to scope all operations to a single project.
INSIGHT_HUB_PROJECT_API_KEY:=your-insight-hub-project-api-key

# Required for Reflect tools
export REFLECT_API_TOKEN=your-reflect-api-token

# Required for API Hub tools
export API_HUB_API_KEY=your-api-hub-api-key

# Optional: Enable error reporting for the MCP server itself
export MCP_SERVER_INSIGHT_HUB_API_KEY=your-monitoring-api-key

```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The¬†`MCP_SERVER_INSIGHT_HUB_API_KEY`¬†is used for monitoring the MCP server itself and should be different from your main application's API key.

## MCP Host Configuration

Configure your MCP host to connect to the SmartBear server. Below are examples for popular clients. In all cases, replace¬†`<PATH_TO_SMARTBEAR_MCP>`¬†with the absolute path to your cloned repository.

### VS Code with GitHub Co-Pilot

Create or edit¬†`.vscode/mcp.json`¬†in your workspace:

```
{
  "servers": {
    "smartbear": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
      	"-y",
      	"@smartbear/mcp@latest"
      	],
      "env": {
        "INSIGHT_HUB_AUTH_TOKEN": "${input:insight_hub_auth_token}",
        "INSIGHT_HUB_PROJECT_API_KEY": "${input:insight_hub_project_api_key}",
        "REFLECT_API_TOKEN": "${input:reflect_api_token}",
        "API_HUB_API_KEY": "${input:api_hub_api_key}"
      }
    }
  },
  "inputs": [
    {
      "id": "insight_hub_auth_token",
      "type": "promptString",
      "description": "Insight Hub Auth Token",
      "password": true
    },
    {
      "id": "insight_hub_project_api_key",
      "type": "promptString",
      "description": "Insight Hub Project API Key - for single project interactions",
      "password": false
    },
    {
      "id": "reflect_api_token",
      "type": "promptString",
      "description": "Reflect API Token",
      "password": true
    },
    {
      "id": "api_hub_api_key",
      "type": "promptString",
      "description": "API Hub API Key",
      "password": true
    }
  ]
}

```

### Cursor

Add to your¬†`mcp.json`¬†configuration:

```
{
  "servers": {
    "smartbear": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
      	"-y",
      	"@smartbear/mcp@latest"
      	],
      "env": {
        "INSIGHT_HUB_AUTH_TOKEN": "your-insight-hub-auth-token",
        "INSIGHT_HUB_PROJECT_API_KEY": "your-insight-hub-project-api-key",
        "REFLECT_API_TOKEN": "your-reflect-api-token",
        "API_HUB_API_KEY": "your-api-hub-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}

```

### Claude Desktop

Edit your¬†`claude_desktop_config.json`¬†file:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "smartbear": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
      	"-y",
      	"@smartbear/mcp@latest"
      	],
      "env": {
        "INSIGHT_HUB_AUTH_TOKEN": "your-insight-hub-auth-token",
        "INSIGHT_HUB_PROJECT_API_KEY": "your-insight-hub-project-api-key",
        "REFLECT_API_TOKEN": "your-reflect-api-token",
        "API_HUB_API_KEY": "your-api-hub-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}

```

### Claude Code

Claude Code has native support for MCP servers.¬†If you've installed the¬†SmartBear MCP Server globally, you can connect it to Claude Code with:

```
claude mcp add --transport stdio smartbear node mcp

```

Alternatively, if you've scoped the MCP Server installation to a¬†local project, use:

```
claude mcp add --transport stdio smartbear npx mcp

```

Then set the required environment variables:

```
export INSIGHT_HUB_AUTH_TOKEN=your-insight-hub-auth-token
export INSIGHT_HUB_PROJECT_API_KEY=your-insight-hub-project-api-key
export REFLECT_API_TOKEN=your-reflect-api-token
export API_HUB_API_KEY=your-api-hub-api-key

```

Launch Claude Code with:

```
claude

```

You'll have access to all SmartBear tools within your Claude Code sessions.

### Other MCP Hosts

The SmartBear MCP Server follows standard MCP protocols and should work with any client that supports:

-   STDIO transport mode
-   Environment variable configuration
-   Standard MCP tool calling conventions

### Building the Server

You can also build the SmartBear MCP Server locally, and raise PRs back via GitHub. To do so, clone the repository and build it locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp.git
cd smartbear-mcp
npm install
npm run build

```

This will create a¬†`dist/index.js`¬†file that serves as the MCP server executable.

### Running the Server (VSCode Example)

To run the built server locally in VS Code, add the following configuration to¬†`.vscode/mcp.json`¬†replacing¬†`<PATH_TO_SMARTBEAR_MCP>`¬†with the location of this repo on your filesystem:

```
{
  "servers": {
    "smartbear": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["<PATH_TO_SMARTBEAR_MCP>/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "INSIGHT_HUB_AUTH_TOKEN": "${input:insight_hub_auth_token}",
		"INSIGHT_HUB_PROJECT_API_KEY": "${input:insight_hub_project_api_key}",
        "REFLECT_API_TOKEN": "${input:reflect_api_token}",
        "API_HUB_API_KEY": "${input:api_hub_api_key}"
      }
    }
  },
  "inputs": [
      {
         "id": "insight_hub_auth_token",
         "type": "promptString",
         "description": "Insight Hub Auth Token",
         "password": true
      },
      {
         "id": "insight_hub_project_api_key",
         "type": "promptString",
         "description": "Insight Hub Project API Key - for single project interactions",
         "password": false
      },
      {
         "id": "reflect_api_token",
         "type": "promptString",
         "description": "Reflect API Token",
         "password": true
      },
      {
         "id": "api_hub_api_key",
         "type": "promptString",
         "description": "API Hub API Key",
         "password": true
      }
  ]
}

```

### Testing with MCP Inspector

To test the MCP server locally before integrating with your preferred host, you can use the MCP Inspector:

```
INSIGHT_HUB_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token\
INSIGHT_HUB_PROJECT_API_KEY=your_project_api_key\
REFLECT_API_TOKEN=your_reflect_token\
API_HUB_API_KEY=your_api_hub_key\
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/index.js

```

## Usage Examples

Once configured, you can interact with SmartBear tools through natural language queries in your AI assistant. Here are examples based on the available tools:
